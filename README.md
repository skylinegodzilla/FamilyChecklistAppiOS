# FamilyChecklistAppiOS
The iOS interface for the Spring Boot project I built for studying full stack.

This is still in the early stages. 
This project needs the springboot server backend to work. even if it's just running locally in IntelliJ so that the simulator can talk to it.
I will be adding in mocked demo mode so that the simulator can run without talking to the server.
I will also be adding offline support once the project is built.
But for now, it still needs at least a localhosted version of the backend.
