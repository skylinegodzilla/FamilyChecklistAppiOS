# FamilyChecklistAppiOS
The iOS interface for the Spring Boot project I built for studying full stack.
It's a sandbox project for educational purposes.

This is still in the early stages. 
This project needs the springboot server backend to work. even if it's just running locally in IntelliJ so that the simulator can talk to it (this can be done using a DEV Scheme build).
It will need to be deployed on a server if it is to be used with real devices. (UAT and PROD Schemes are set up to handle that)
I will be adding in mocked demo mode so that the simulator can run without talking to the server.
I will also be adding offline support once the project is built.
But for now, it still needs at least a localhosted version of the backend.
